# Lexa

Mathematics visualisation tool with parser for mathematical syntax. This project is a learning exercise, so features that I would usually use libraries for have been implemented from scratch (such as text rendering/UI design). 
This is a WIP! Currently I have only verified that it compiles and runs on my machine using visual studio 2022.
